Developed and Trained Neural Networks:

Created a neural network (multi-layer perceptron) using NumPy for handwritten digit recognition on the MNIST dataset. Additionally, implemented and optimized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using PyTorch for image classification tasks, achieving high accuracy on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
